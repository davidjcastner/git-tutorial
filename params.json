Simply search Google or YouTube for \"terminal tutorial\" plus your operating system. Both the git shell and mac OS use linux based commands\r\n\r\n**[Terminal Commands Cheat Sheet](https://gist.github.com/LeCoupa/122b12050f5fb267e75f)**\r\n\r\n### Basic git Commands (used throughout the labs)\r\n\r\nAll of these commands do not provide any functionality; they only provide useful information, so feel free to use these throughout the labs.\r\n\r\n**git help** - show a list of commands for git and what they do  \r\n**git help _command_** - detailed explanation of what the command does and what the options do  \r\n**git config -l** - list out the configuration settings for git  \r\n**git status** - shows status of current working tree (very useful)  \r\n**git branch** - list out the branches and shows which is the current working branch\r\n\r\n### Labs\r\n\r\nThe following labs will walk though the basic process of creating a repository, adding work to the repository, and some basic management for the repository. The labs need to be completed in order as they build upon each other.\r\n\r\nThe labs are done via command line even though GitHub provides a way for actions to be done through a visual interface. Despite that, I recommend becoming familiar with the git command line tools. It may be very challenging and intimidating at first, but once you get use to it, it will be very useful and saves a lot time.\r\n\r\n**[Lab 1: Creating a repository and making the first commit](Lab1.md)**\r\n\r\n**[Lab 2: Understanding remote and local work](Lab2.md)**\r\n\r\n**[Lab 3: Creating branches and merging](Lab3.md)**\r\n\r\n### Closing Remarks\r\n\r\nAlmost anything you do with git/GitHub can be undone, so don’t worry if you mess up. (although figuring out how to undo it can be tricky sometimes)\r\n\r\nIf you can’t remember how to do a certain action or don’t know how, just search for it on Google. The top links are usually answers to your question from GitHub Docs or answers on StackOverflow\r\n\r\n### Issues with the labs\r\n\r\nIf you experience issues with the labs feel free to post the issues in the issues section of this repository on GitHub, and I will try to help you when I get some time.\r\n",
